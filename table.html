The diagram illustrates the process by which geothermal energy is used in the production of electricity.
Overall, there are five stages from pumped down cold water into geothermal zone and producing electricity from the generator and sent it to the electric grid.<p>
In first stage cold water is pumped down to 4.5km underground through the injection well. Next the cold water passed to geothermal zone. In this stage water can be heated by the hot rocks and pumped up above the earth through production well to the condenser, and the remaining two stages could be done on above the earth.</p>
In condenser heat water produces stream and makes spin the turbine. After the turbine spins can be powered by stream, and then generator powered by turbine and produces electricity and the power can be sent It to the electric grid through the electric line. <hr><hr>
